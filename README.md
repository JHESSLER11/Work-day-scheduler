# Work Day Scheduler

## About 
The application can be used to schedule task throughout a 8-5 workday. Hours colored in green are in the future and hours coloed in red are current, while grey hours are in the past. The user can update the task in each hour with their own text. The text will be stored in local storage and will remain if the page is refreshed.
